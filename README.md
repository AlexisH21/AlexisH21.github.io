This was the text based game I made for my programming1 midterm assignment. It's inspired by fairy folklore.
*I struggled quite a lot with is assignment. I struggled with figuring out how to call the fairy class to the game and randomize the information about them.*
*I overcame these challenges by getting help from a tutor and my teacher.*
